## Designing a Switched Mode Power Supply

The SMPS will convert a 220Vrms AC voltage to a 5V and 9V, 0-1A DC output. The design will also feature a software design that will control and monitor the efficiency of the SMPS and itsâ€™ operation with the use of an I2C digital wattmeter and the UCT STM32 board respectively. Trello, project management software will be used by the team to collaborate effectively and define upcoming tasks accordingly.
