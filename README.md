## Designing a Switched Mode Power Supply

The SMPS will convert a 220Vrms AC voltage to a 5V and 9V, 0-1A DC output. The design will also feature a software design that will control and monitor the efficiency of the SMPS and its operation using an I2C digital wattmeter and the UCT STM32 board, respectively. The team will use Trello, project management software to collaborate effectively and define upcoming tasks accordingly.
